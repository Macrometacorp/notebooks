    "Contains the _rev field. GDN supports MVCC (Multiple Version Concurrency Control) and is capable of storing each document in multiple revisions.

    "A Graph consists of vertices and edges. Edges are stored as documents in edge collections. A vertex can be a document of a document collection or of an edge collection (so edges can be used as vertices). Which collections are used within a named graph is defined via edge definitions. A named graph can contain more than one edge definition, at least one is needed. Graphs allow you to structure your models in line with your domain and group them logically in collections and giving you the power to query them in the same graph queries.\n",

    "While simple graph queries with fixed number of hops via the relation table may be doable in SQL with several nested joins, graph databases can handle an arbitrary number of these hops over edge collections - this is called traversal. Also edges in one edge collection may point to several vertex collections. Its common to have attributes attached to edges, i.e. a label naming this interconnection.\n",
