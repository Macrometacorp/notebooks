Welcome to *Distributed Systems & Edge Cloud for Developers.* This Book takes you on a journey of discovery into the world of distributed systems and edge computing.

Together we will experience the art of the possible with Macrometa GDN. This Book provides a series of short tutorials to cover basic and advanced concepts, ranging from simple tasks like connecting to Macrometa GDN and creating a collection or a RestQL API, or more complex tasks like configuring distributed systems and complex event processing (CEP).

Hope you enjoy it!

## How do I get started?

To get started we recommend one of the following options:

1. **Local Host:** Download this Book to your computer and work with the tutorials locally, allowing you to access Macrometa GDN from anywhere in the world. This option connects to the most local GDN point of presence for a P90 50ms RTT. In effect, this simulates how an end device would connect to GDN via an Access Network or ISP.
2. **Macrometa Compute:** Run this Book in Macrometa Compute via Jupyter Hub. This allows you to run workbooks and tutorials from Macrometa GDN. The code of the Tutorials and Workbooks run in the edge cloud itself in the same way a microservice would run on Macrometa Compute (CaaS)
3. **CoLab:** Run this Book in the free service from Google. This lets the Tutorial Code run in a Public Cloud environment, which simulates a more complete picture of how distributed systems can be deployed.

## What is Macrometa GDN?

Macrometa GDN is a first-of-its-kind Edge Cloud. GDN is a converged platform that includes a Multi-Model NoSQL database, pub/sub, event processing, and serverless global data platform for building geo-distributed and real-time applications.

Macrometa's Global Data Network (GDN) allows organizations to tier, cache, process, and serve data with a global P90 roundtrip response time of 50ms. With 175+ points of presence (PoPs) around the world, Macrometa brings data and consistency closer to users while maintaining a coordination-free architecture.

## Software you will use

In this book, you will use Macrometa Python ([PYC8](https://github.com/Macrometacorp/pyC8)) & JavaScript ([JSC8](https://github.com/Macrometacorp/jsC8)) drivers as well as the Macrometa Command Line Interface (GDNSL).

Each method of accessing Macrometa GDN is covered in the tutorials, so if you are familiar with coding in Python, you can try that first before having a go with JavaScript. Each Tutorial accomplishes the same goal using different drivers or GDNSL. 

As you progress in your understanding, you can determine which method works best for your application or use case. You might want to focus on Python when building your edge application that I based around Machine Learning or Edge AI. 

Perhaps you will focus on an application that is built with React.js, and you will find the JavaScript Driver lets you do cool things there. You may be super interested in Automation and CI/CD, in which case you may find the GDNSL makes the most sense. 

But don't worry about that now, just jump in, have fun, and start building cool edge applications with Macrometa GDN!
