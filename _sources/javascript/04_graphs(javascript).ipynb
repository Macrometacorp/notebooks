    "Today’s applications are required to be highly responsive and always online. They need to be deployed in data centers closer to their users and can access data instantly across the globe.\n",
    "\n",
    "Macrometa global data network (GDN) is a fully managed real-time materialized view engine that provides access to data instantly to Apps & APIs in a single and straightforward interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "This article introduces working with documents in GDN with jsC8 drivers.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the drivers, a document is a dictionary/object that is JSON serializable with the following properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "- It contains the `_key` field, which identifies the document uniquely within a specific collection.\n",
    "- It contains the `_id` field (also called the handle), which identifies the document uniquely across all collections within a fabric. This ID is a combination of the collection name and the document key using the format `{collection}/{key}` (see example below).\n",
    "- It contains the `_rev` field. GDN supports MVCC (Multiple Version Concurrency Control) and is capable of storing each document in multiple revisions. This field indicates the latest revision of a document. The field is populated by GDN and is not required as input unless you want to validate a document against its current revision.\n",

    "A Graph consists of vertices and edges. Edges are stored as documents in edge collections. A vertex can be a document of a document collection or of an edge collection (so edges can be used as vertices). Which collections are used within a named graph is defined via edge definitions. A named graph can contain more than one edge definition; at least one is needed. Graphs allow you to structure your models in line with your domain and group them logically in collections, giving you the power to query them in the same graph queries.\n",

    "While simple graph queries with a fixed number of hops via the relation table may be doable in SQL with several nested joins, graph databases can handle an arbitrary number of these hops over edge collections - this is called traversal. Also, edges in one edge collection may point to several vertex collections. Finally, it's common to have attributes attached to edges, i.e., a label naming this interconnection.\n",
