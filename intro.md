# Welcome to your Macrometa Work Book & Tutotials

The Work Book has been created to take you on a journey of descovery.

Together we will expereince the art of the possible with Macrometa GDN, 
through a series of short tutorials spanning basic concepts of how to
connect to Macrometa GDN and create a collection, creating and updating 
RESTQL APIS, to more advanced concepts like distributed systems and Complex
Event Processing!

Hope you enjoy!

the Macrometa Team
